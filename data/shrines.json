Nestled amidst tangerine orchards, this cave served as a retreat for Musashi during his later years. Here, he is believed to have penned his legendary book, The Book of Five Rings, a treatise on swordsmanship and strategy. Visitors can explore the serene cave surroundings and witness the hundreds of weathered stone statues (Gohyaku Rakan) representing the 500 disciples of Buddha who attained enlightenment. Pay homage at the enshrined statue of Kannon, the Bodhisattva of Compassion. Reigandō offers a glimpse into the life and legacy of Miyamoto Musashi, a figure who continues to inspire swordsmen and strategists alike. There's a great restaurant halfway up to the cave, try the curry!",

This traditional event involves setting the dry grass on the mountainside ablaze in a controlled burn, creating a fiery spectacle visible from all over Nara. The tradition supposedly originated from a boundary dispute between two temples, Tōdai-ji and Kōfuku-ji in 1760; it is said after mediation failed, the entire mountain was set ablaze. If you're leaving at night during this festival, you can see the burn from the JR train.

    "description": "Itto-seki, literally meaning 'one-sword cut', is a massive split boulder located in the picturesque Yagyu countryside. Legend attributes the split to the legendary swordsman Yagyu Muneyoshi (also known as Sekishūsai), who sliced the rock in one swift stroke during his training.  The mysterious boulder has become a popular pilgrimage site, especially for fans of the anime and manga series 'Demon Slayer' (Kimetsu no Yaiba), due to a similar scene involving a split rock.  Visitors can admire the impressive size and clean split of the Itto-seki, and immerse themselves in the local legends surrounding this historical landmark. Visit Amenoiwatate Jinja on your way to the boulder.",
