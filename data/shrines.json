Nestled amidst tangerine orchards, this cave served as a retreat for Musashi during his later years. Here, he is believed to have penned his legendary book, The Book of Five Rings, a treatise on swordsmanship and strategy. Visitors can explore the serene cave surroundings and witness the hundreds of weathered stone statues (Gohyaku Rakan) representing the 500 disciples of Buddha who attained enlightenment. Pay homage at the enshrined statue of Kannon, the Bodhisattva of Compassion. Reigandō offers a glimpse into the life and legacy of Miyamoto Musashi, a figure who continues to inspire swordsmen and strategists alike.
